       );

DESCRIPTION
    Term::Report can be used to generate nicely formatted dynamic output. It
    can also use Term::StatusBar to show progress and Number::Format so
    numbers show up more readable. All output is sent to STDOUT by default.

    The current release may not be compatible with previous code. Many
    changes were made with regards to how output could be formatted.

METHODS
  new(parameters)
       cls       - This clears the screen. Default is 1.
       startRow  - This indicates which row to start at. Default is 1.
       startCol  - This indicates which column to start at. Default is 1.
       numFormat - This indicates if you want to use Number::Format. Default is undef.
       statusBar - This indicates if you want to use Term::StatusBar. Default is undef.
       fh        - User-defined file handle. This is passed on to Term::StatusBar. Default is STDOUT.

    numFormat and statusBar can be passed in 2 different ways.

    The first way is as a simple flag: numFormat => 1

    Or as an array reference with parameters for a Number::Format object:
    numFormat => [-MON_DECIMAL_POINT => ',', -INT_CURR_SYMBOL => '']

    statusBar behaves the same way except takes parameters appropriate for
    Term::StatusBar.

  finePrint($row, $col, @text)
    This gives more control over where to place text. With the introduction
    of 'save points', $row may be either a number, indicating a row, or a
    savepoint label, which may not be all numbers or it will be interpreted
    as a row.

  printLine(@text)
    This places text after the last known text has been placed. It tries
    very hard to "Do The Right Thing", but I am certain there are more
    'bugs' in it.

  lineLength('m')
    Returns length($obj->{m}). This function shouldn't really be called as
    it has little purpose outside the module.

  _adjustCurRow($text)
    Internal function printLine() uses to try and place text properly.

  printBarReport($header, $config)
    Works in conjunction with Term::StatusBar to print a summary of data it
    processed.

  savePoint($label, $text, $print)
    Allows the referencing of a screen position with a text label. This
    calls printLine() and remembers the position it was placed in, along
    with the text it represents. $print is a flag indicating whether to
    immediately print the $text, or to delay it.

  clear()
    Clears the screen and resets currentRow to startRow. This is mostly for
    re-using the report object within the same script. The actual cursor is
    set to (0,0).

  finished()
    Accurately places the cursor at the last line of the 'report'.

CHANGES
       2003-06-13
          + When clearing screen, set cursor at (0,0).
          + Changed escape sequence to \033.

       2003-06-11
          + Caught bad savepoint names being passed to finePrint().
             - These will now die().
          + Fixed bug with finePrint() not correctly tracking currentRow.
          + Don't exit() in DESTROY blocks any more. Just reset terminal.
          + Changed 2nd parameter to printBarReport() from {} to [] to keep ordering correct.
             - The old hash ref will still work, but ordering is not guaranteed.
          + Added clear() method to clear the screen.
             - Allows report object to be re-used. This must be called before StatusBar::reset().

       2003-05-06
          + Added "no warnings 'portable'" so Perl 5.8 would be happy.
          + Added ability to send in a file handle to print to.

       2003-01-27
          + Removed the dependency for Term::ANSIScreen.
          + Added savePoint() method for easy referencing of screen locations.
          + Adjusted finePrint() to work with savePoint().
          + Added 'cls' flag to constructor to clear the screen.
          + Cleaned up code a bit with minor optimizations.
          + Reduced screen flicker by quite a bit.
